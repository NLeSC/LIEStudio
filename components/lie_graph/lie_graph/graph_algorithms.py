    Eigenvector centrality for nodes in the graph (like Google's PageRank).

    Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the importance of a node in a directed network.
    It rewards nodes with a high potential of (indirectly) connecting to high-scoring nodes.
    Nodes with no incoming connections have a score of zero.
    If you want to measure outgoing connections, reversed should be False.

    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method.
    It has no guarantee of convergence.
    A starting vector for the power iteration can be given in the start dict.

    You can adjust the importance of a node with the rating dictionary,
    which links node id's to a score.
